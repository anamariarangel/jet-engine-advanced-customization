# Change JetFilters Language

This project addresses the issue of month names appearing in English in the JetFilters calendar filter (Crocoblock). By default, JetFilters does not offer an option to change the language of the months.

## Why use this script?

The Crocoblock team suggests using translation plugins like WPML or Polylang to change the language. However, if your website is entirely in Portuguese and does not require additional translations, installing these plugins can be unnecessary and heavy. This JavaScript code provides a lightweight and straightforward solution.

## How does it work?

1. **Month Translation**: The script translates month names from English to Portuguese.
2. **Easy Integration**: It can be added directly to the Elementor Custom Code section, theme files, or a custom plugin.
3. **Dynamic Monitoring**: Observes DOM changes to ensure dynamically added elements are also translated.

## How to Use?

1. Copy the code into the Elementor Custom Code section, or:
   - Insert it into theme files (e.g., `functions.php`).
   - Add it to a custom plugin.

2. No additional configuration is required.

## Benefits

- Lightweight and efficient solution.
- No need for additional plugins.
- Works seamlessly on websites fully in Portuguese.
